THE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:
INTRODUCTION
1. Equifax Inc. is a consumer credit reporting agency headquartered in
Atlanta, Georgia ("Equifax"). In its ordinary course of business, Equifax
compiles and stores a vast collection of consumer information, which it
sells to other businesses and organizations seeking to use the information
to assess creditworthiness or verify identity. Equifax thus holds a colossal
repository of sensitive personally identifiable information, including full
names, addresses, social security numbers, birth dates, and driver's license
numbers, belonging to hundreds of millions of individuals in the United
States and abroad. This data compilation was confidential, proprietary
business information for Equifax, and the company stored the information
on restricted, nonpublic servers located in Alpharetta, Georgia and
elsewhere.

2. Beginning on an unknown date, but at least by on or about May 13,
2017, and continuing through on or about July 30, 2017, members of the
People's Liberation Army ("P LA"), the armed forces of the People's
Republic of China ("China"), conspired with each other to hack into the
protected computers of Equifax located in the Northern District of Georgia,
to maintain unauthorized access to those computers, and to steal sensitive
personally identifiable information of 145 million Americans.
3. The PLA hackers obtained names, birth dates, and social security
numbers for the 145 million American victims, in addition to driver's
license numbers for at least 10 million Americans stored on Equifax's
databases. The hackers also collected credit card numbers and Other
personally identifiable information belonging to approximately 200,000
American consumers. Accordingly, in a single breach, the PLA obtained
sensitive personally identifiable information for nearly half of all American
citizens.
4. In addition, the PLA hackers obtained personally identifiable
information belonging to nearly a million citizens of the United Kingdom
and Canada,
BACKGROUND
5. At all times relevant to this Indictment:
a. Equifax hosted an online dispute portal that permitted users
to research and dispute potential inaccuracies in their Equifax credit
reports on servers located in Alpharetta, Georgia. The online dispute
portal used the Apache Struts Web Framework, an open-source software
package for developing web-based applications.
2

****** Result for Image/Page 3 ******
b. In connection with the management and protection of its
databases, Equifax developed and maintained proprietary compilations,
designs, processes, and codes that constituted trade secrets, for which it
had taken reasonable measures to keep secret and which derived
independent economic value from not being generally known to, and not
being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who
could obtain economic value from the disclosure and use of the
information. This trade secret information included the above-described
personally identifiable information Equifax had acquired at great effort
and expense and that enabled it to operate its business and compete in the
marketplace— that is, its data compilations as well as the means by which
Equifax accessed and analyzed that information, that is, its database
schemas.
c. On or about March 7, 2017, Apache announced a vulnerability
in certain versions of Apache Struts software that permitted unauthorized
users to access the Apache Struts Web Framework and perform a remote
code execution attack on a target web application. The United States
Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued a threat warning notice
about the vulnerability on or about the following day. The vulnerability
was not patched on Equifa)ds online dispute portal.
d. Defendants WU ZHIYONG, whose photograph is attached as
Exhibit A; WANG QIAN, whose photograph is attached as Exhibit B; XU
KE, whose photograph is attached as Exhibit C; and LIU LEI were
3

****** Result for Image/Page 4 ******
residents of Beijing, China and members of the 54th Research Institute,
which was a component of the PLA.
e. A web shell was a script that can be uploaded to a web server
to enable remote administration of the server. A web shell can be used by
an attacker to gain access to functions on the server and to maintain
persistent access to a compromised server.
COUNT ONE
(Computer Fraud Conspiracy)
6. Beginning on an unknown date, but at least by on or about May 13,
2017, and continuing through on or about July 30, 2017, the exact dates
being unknown to the Grand Jury, in the Northern District of Georgia and
elsewhere, the defendants, WU ZHIYONG, WANG QIAN, XU ICE, and
LIU LEI, did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire, confederate,
agree, and have a tacit understanding with each other and other persons
known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to commit offenses against the
United States, namely:
a. to intentionally access protected computers without
authorization and thereby obtain information from protected
computers in furtherance of the criminal act of economic
espionage in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section
1831(a)(2), with the value of such information exceeding
$5,000, all in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections
and and
4

****** Result for Image/Page 5 ******
b. to knowingly cause the fransmission of a program,
information, code, and command, and as a result of such
conduct, to intentionally cause damage without authorization
to a protected computer, and where the offense did cause loss
aggregating at least $5,000 in value to at least one person
during a one-year period from a related course of conduct
affecting a protected computer, and damage affecting at least
ten protected computers during a one-year period, in violation
of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1030(a)(5)(A) and
MANNER AND MEANS OF THE CONSPIRACY
7. It was part of the conspiracy that the defendants, WU ZHIYONG,
WANG QIAN, XU KE, and LIU LEI, and others hacked into Equifax's
computer networks, maintained unauthorized access to those networks,
and stole login credentials and sensitive personally identifiable
information that were stored on databases within those networks, as well
as protected trade secrets.
8. The conspirators exploited the Apache Struts vulnerability to upload
to an Equifax web server multiple unauthorized web shells and began
reconnaissance of Equifax's online dispute portal, After gaining access to
the web server, the conspirators interacted with Equifax's back-end
databases by installing web shells created through Apache Struts and
issuing commands using Structured Query Language ("SQL"), a database
management language commonly used to query and manipulate data. The
5

****** Result for Image/Page 6 ******
conspirators also located and used Equifax database service credentials
and thereby falsely represented that they were authorized users of
Equifax's network, which permitted them to access additional back-end
databases.
9. The conspirators ran a series of queries to search for sensitive
personally identifiable information within Equifax's databases. After
locating a repository of names, addresses, social security numbers, and
birth dates, the conspirators ran additional queries to extract this data. In
total, the attackers ran approximately 9,000 queries on Equifax's system
while masking this activity through encrypted communication channels.
The majority of these queries were issued by conspirators using two
China-based IP addresses that connected directly to Equifax's network,
10. The conspirators stored the stolen information in temporary files,
compressed and divided the large data files into more manageable file
sizes for transmission, and executed Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP")
commands to download the data files.
11. The conspirators attempted to hide the origin and location of their
internet traffic and reduce the likelihood of detection by using
approximately thirty-four servers located in nearly twenty countries to
infiltrate Equifax's network. The conspirators also employed a variety of
encrypted login protocols, including Remote Desktop Protocol and Secure
Shell software, which permitted them to connect to servers over network
connections from other servers they controlled. To further disguise their
infrastructure, the conspirators obtained access to the servers located
6

****** Result for Image/Page 7 ******
outside of China from reseller hosting services, who purchase remote
computing services from other providers and then lease those remote
computing services to others.
12. Additionally, the conspirators attempted to disguise their
unauthorized access to Equifax's online dispute portal by using existing
encrypted communication channels within Equifax's network to send
queries and commands, which allowed them to blend in with normal
network activity, By compressing and dividing the data files, the
conspirators also disguised the exfiltration of sensitive personally
identifiable information.
13. To further conceal their activity, the conspirators deleted the
compressed files after exfiltrating the sensitive data. In addition, the
conspirators configured settings on at least one of their leased servers that
wiped log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their
activity.
OVERT ACTS
14. In furtherance of the conspiracy, and to effect the purpose and
objects thereof, the defendants, WU ZHIYONG, WANG QIAN, XU KE,
and LIU LEI, and others committed various overt acts in the Northern
District of Georgia and elsewhere, including, but not limited to, the
following:
a. On or about May 13, 2017, a conspirator began exploiting the
Apache Struts vulnerability within Equifax's online dispute portal and
created a web shell to grant back door access to the portal. Through this
7

****** Result for Image/Page 8 ******
initial access, the conspirators obtained database service login credentials
that could be used to navigate to databases within Equifax's network.
b. After exploiting the vulnerability, the conspirators conducted
reconnaissance on Equifax's online dispute portal over several weeks by
running a series of queries to identify Equifax's database structure and the
number of records within it. The conspirators reviewed database records
in small segments through a combination of Apache Struts commands,
malicious web shells created through Apache Struts, and SQL commands,
c. For example, on or about May 13, 2017, a conspirator ran SQL
commands to identify table names and column names for an Equifax
database table. The conspirator then sampled a select number of records
from the database.
d. Between on or about May 13, 2017, and on or about July 24,
2017, the conspirators accessed a file containing sensitive personally
identifiable information. After querying database tables, the conspirators
stored results in output files, which were then split into smaller segments
to facilitate a quicker download while attempting to lessen the risk of
detection.
e. On or about June 16, 2017, a conspirator using a China-based
IP address ("China Server #1"), which was repeatedly accessed during the
intrusion by WANG QIAN, logged into a Taiwanese IP address ("the
Taiwan Server") via Remote Desktop Protocol software and copied the
malicious file "jndi.txt." A substantively identical web shell, "Jquery-
1.3.2.min.jsp," was then uploaded to the Equifax network.
8

****** Result for Image/Page 9 ******
f. On or about July 5, 2017, a conspirator who was using a Swiss
IP address ("the Swiss Serve€') connected to the Equifax network and
accessed a database by using the username and password for one of the
compromised database service accounts, After gaining access to the
database, the conspirator queried the database table for social security
numbers.
g. On or about July 6, 2017, a conspirator who was logged into
the Swiss Server connected to the Equifax network and queried a database
for social security numbers, full names, and address information and
placed the results in output files, After creating the output files, the
conspirators created a compressed file archive of the results and copied it
to a different directory prior to downloading the archive. Following the
download of the personally identifiable information, the conspirators
deleted the archive in an effort to conceal their activity.
h. On or about the same day, a conspirator who was logged into
the Swiss Server connected to the Equifax network, accessed a different
back-end database by using the username and password for another
compromised database service account, and queried the database.
i. On or about July 7, 2017, a conspirator who was logged into
the Swiss Server connected to the Equifax network, accessed a third back-
end database by using the username and password for yet another
compromised database service account, and queried the database.
j. On or about the same day, another China-based IP address
("China Server #2"), which was also repeatedly accessed during the
9

****** Result for Image/Page 10 ******
intrusion by WANG QIAN, exploited the Apache Struts vulnerability on
Equifax's online dispute portal.
k, On or about the same day and July 9, 2017, XU KE used a
different China-based IP address ("China Server #3") to conduct
reconnaissance on Equifax's online dispute portal.
l. On or about July 10, 2017, a conspirator using another China-
based IP address ("China Server #4") logged into the Taiwan Server and
copied the malicious file "abc.txt" to the Taiwan Server. A conspirator
using another China-based IP address ("China Server #5") then utilized
the malicious web shell "css.jsp," which was previously installed on
Equifax's network, to issue a command to download the "abc.txt" file from
the Taiwan Server. Minutes later, a conspirator using China Server #5
uploaded a substantively identical web shell, "ss.jsp," to the Equifax
network.
m. On or about the same day, a conspirator logged into the Swiss
Server, connected to the Equifax network, and issued a command to create
an archive containing 49 directories. Once the archive was created, a
conspirator split it into 600 megabyte segments, which were then
downloaded from the Equifax network to a Dutch server via HTTP
commands.
n. On or about the same day, a conspirator who was logged into
another China-based IP address ("China Server #6") utilized the malicious
web shell "boxover.jsp" to query an Equifax database table and store the
results in output files. Using China Server #6, the conspirator then
10

****** Result for Image/Page 11 ******
compressed the output file into an archive file and downloaded the
archive using HTTP commands. Following the download, the conspirator
then used the "css.jsp" web shell to delete the archive from Equifax's
network in an effort to conceal the theft.
o. On or about July 20, 2017 through on or about July 22, 2017,
WANG QIAN, using China Server #2, remotely accessed the malicious
web shell "six.jsp" on an Equifax server, which permitted WANG to issue
unauthorized SQL commands to one of Equifax's back-end databases. On
or about July 22, 2017, a Singapore-based IP address ("the Singapore
Served') connected to an Equifax server and accessed the same "six.jsp
web shell to run additional queries on Equifax's databases.
p. The conspirators continued to perform queries to compress,
download, and delete output files containing personally identifiable
information stolen from Equifax's back-end databases until on or about
July 30, 2017.
q, On or about July 30, 2017, LIU LEI, using the Singapore
Server, remotely accessed the malicious web shell "ss.jsp" on an Equifax
server.
All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 371.
